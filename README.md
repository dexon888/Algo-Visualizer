# Algo-Visualizer
# Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a web application designed to help users understand and visualize various algorithms. The visualizer provides step-by-step animations of different algorithms, including sorting algorithms, pathfinding algorithms, and string matching algorithms. It is a tool for both students and professionals to gain a better understanding of how these algorithms work.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher) or yarn (v1 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install

3. Start the development server
    ```sh
    npm start

# Usage:
- Home Page: The home page features a typewriter effect that alternates between "Algorithm Visualizer" and "Tool for Algorithm Comprehension". From here, you can navigate to different sections of the visualizer.
- Sorting Algorithms: Select and visualize various sorting algorithms. Adjust the number of bars and generate a new array to see different sorting behaviors.
- Pathfinding Algorithms: Generate a grid with walls, start, and end nodes. Visualize different pathfinding algorithms to see how they find paths from the start to the end node.
- String Algorithms: Input text and patterns to visualize string matching algorithms like Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP).

# Algorithms Sections:
### Sorting Algorithms:
- Selection Sort: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Bubble Sort: Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements that are out of order.
- Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one item at a time.
- Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves.
- Quick Sort: A fast divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- Counting Sort: A non-comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- Heap Sort: A comparison-based algorithm that uses a binary heap data structure.

### Pathfinding Algorithms:
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores a graph by expanding the deepest node in the frontier.
- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores a graph by expanding the shallowest nodes first.
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
- A* Algorithm: Finds the shortest path using heuristics to optimize the search.
- Bellman-Ford Algorithm: Computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph.

### String Algorithms:
- Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP): An efficient string matching algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to determine the shifts of the pattern itself for avoiding unnecessary comparisons
